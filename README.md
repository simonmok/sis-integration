# SIS integration for Blackboard Learn
This program allows you to perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) on CSV data sources and upload to Blackboard Learn system. The program uses Blackboard Learn SIS Framework (https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/Hosting/System_Integration/SIS/SIS_Framework_Overview). It uses polling on Blackboard Data Set Status API (https://help.blackboard.com/Learn/Administrator/Hosting/System_Integration/SIS/SIS_Integration_Types/Snapshot_Flat_File/Snapshot_Auto) to monitor and report the progress of SIS job execution.
